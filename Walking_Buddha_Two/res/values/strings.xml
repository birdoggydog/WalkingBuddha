   	<string name="About_Us">All donations go to maintain the Amitabha Stupa in Sedona Arizona so that it and it\'s 13 surrounding acres remain freely open to the public as a place of pilgrimage. \n\n What is a stupa? Imagine a place where you can go to pray that magnifies that prayer a hundred fold. A place where a living presence of compassion and enlightened mind exists with the sole purpose of being a beacon that radiates blessings to all who come within 100 miles of its location.  That\'s exactly what a stupa is. When you come to a stupa to make prayers with the pure intention of bringing benefit to others, it can change your life, your heart, your mind profoundly. \n\n What is a mantra? In short, a prayer to purify the mind from any suffering or obscuration.  \n\nPlease pass this along to all who would benefit.</string>
