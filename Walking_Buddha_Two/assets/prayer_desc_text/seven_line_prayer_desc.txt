The Seven-Line prayer is called “the King of Prayers”. 
Through repetition of this prayer many obstacles can be removed from your life, 
and your connection to your own spiritual nature is strengthened. 
With unshakable faith visualize Guru Rinpoche, 
the embodiment of all refuges on the crown of ones head and pray.
