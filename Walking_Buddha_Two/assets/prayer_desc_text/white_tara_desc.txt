White Tara is associated with long life and her mantra is often chanted with a particular person in mind.  
Specifically Mama means “mine” – that you want the qualities of long life, merit, wisdom and compassion either
 for yourself or another. Ayuh mean long life. Punya  refers to the results of living life ethically – 
 which would be a long and happy life. Jnana means wisdom.  
 Pushtim means abundance or increase. Kuru “make it so”. Svaha means many blessings be upon you.  
 So repeating the mantra is a prayer for the increase of merit and wisdom to the extent that one can become 
 enlightened and be of benefit and end the suffering of all sentient beings.
