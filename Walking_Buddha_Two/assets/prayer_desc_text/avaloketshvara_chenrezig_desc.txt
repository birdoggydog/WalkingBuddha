It is said that all the teachings of the Buddha are contained in this mantra. 
Om (perfection in practice of generosity) 
Ma (perfection in the practice of pure ethics) 
Ni (perfection in the practice of tolerance and patience) 
Pad (perfection of perseverance) 
Me (perfection in the practice of concentration) 
Hum (perfection in the practice of Wisdom).  
The six syllables purify the six realms of existence in suffering.
Saying the mantra invokes the powerful benevolent attention and blessings of Chenrezig, 
the embodiment of compassion.
