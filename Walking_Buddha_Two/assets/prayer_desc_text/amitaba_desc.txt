Amitabha is the Buddha of infinite light. 
His special quality is infinite and boundless compassion. 
It is taught that such is the depth of his compassion for all sentient beings in all places, states and times - 
that remembering his name or repeating his mantra will lead to the easing 
and eventual end of the poisons in ones life. Emotions can stabilize and spiritual health can increase.
 It is said that upon ones death, merely thinking of him will lead to rebirth in a “pure” realm.
