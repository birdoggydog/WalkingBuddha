WalkingBuddha
=============

Android Stupa App - allows users to look up prayers, with descriptions and text available.  Then let's a user choose from a set of stupas,
the stupas are then "walked around" via displaying a sequence of photos, while a prayer text is visble. 

Users may press the plus/minus buttons to increment a prayer counter to keep track ov the number of prayers they have said.
Repo for the Walking Buddha virtual Stupa Circumambulation application.
